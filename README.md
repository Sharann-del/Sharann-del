## About Me

I’m a developer focused on **iOS app development and modern web systems**, with a strong interest in **productivity tools, system design, and scalable user interfaces**.

I enjoy building products from the ground up — from **idea → architecture → UI → deployment** — and I care deeply about how software *feels* to use, not just how it works.


## What I’m Working On

- **iOS apps** using SwiftUI (widgets, planners, task systems)
- **Web dashboards & tools** with React, TypeScript, and APIs
- Exploring advanced UI patterns, animations, and state management
- Designing reusable systems rather than one-off features


## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- SwiftUI, React, TypeScript, JavaScript
- Modern UI patterns, component-driven design

**Backend**
- Node.js, REST APIs
- PostgreSQL

**Tools & Workflow**
- Xcode, Git, GitHub
- API-driven development
- Clean architecture & maintainable codebases


## Current Goals

- Publish my first production-ready iOS app
- Build a strong, high-quality developer portfolio
- Create tools that genuinely save time and reduce friction
